Files:
  * README          - This file.
  * path-problem.sh - Script provided by Astonish Designs
  * pather          - PHP script written to accomplish this coding challenge
  * my_examples.sh  - Script used to validate specific cases.

Expectations:
* `pather` expects the php interpreter to be located in /usr/bin.  If it is not located here, the script will need to be modified accordingly.
* `pather` includes very little error checking.  It expects the input file consist of a square grid of text, some of that text being hash marks.  IOW, rectangular grids will result in unhandled errors.
